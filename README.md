# Capstone_2025
University of Utah | MSBA Program | SWIRE COCA-COLA Red Truck Customer Project

# Business Problem
Swire does not have a systematic way to identify which customers are expected to be well performing in the future and therefore does not have a clear strategy for which customers they choose to service internally on red truck versus an alternate route to market. The purpose of the project is to identify customers that Swire currently works with that are or will be ordering above/below the threshold set at 400 gallons a year. The project will include developing a model to predict which customers are anticipated to grow above threshold and include analysis on characteristics of profitable red truck customers.

# Group Solution
Our group determined the best model for SWIRE are two multi level model's segmented by retailer/non-retailer customers and using a customer segementation method based on growth and orders as a random effect. We feel this is the best method due to a lack of significant predictors outside of order history

# My Contribution
I contributed to this project equally with my group partner. I spent significant time on EDA of the original data we were provided. I created some of the first iterations of decision trees and regression models. I created the distance metrics to analyze customer locations significane to future order history which led to understanding the need to break out retailers seperatly. I created the MLM model for non-retailers.

# Buisness Value of Solution
Through our segmentation, SWIRE can identify which customers they anticipate to be over threshold in the future or close to it. This will allow them to clearly see who should continue on red truck. We do recommend editing the segmentation and pairing it with financial analysis to make better data driven decisions that would have a positive impact to SWIRE's bottom line

# What I learned
I learned how important it is to have a clear defined business problem. This problem from SWIRE had a lot of different facets and a large scope that at times seemed directionless. I think having a clear purpose to why this question is important as well as what really needs to be answered will help me save time and provide clear and actionable insights in the future.

I also learned how many data questions an organization can and should be asking, but do not have the bandwith to look at, even if it seems simple and straight forward. It makes me wonder what insights I could provide before a topic is even brought to the table.
